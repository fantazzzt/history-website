        <h1>Economic Decline</h1>
        <p>Spanning 284-750 CE</p>

      <p>One of the most important conclusions that recent historical analysis on Late Antiquity has been that the 
        period is not one of sole decline. While the political integrity of Western Roman bureaucratic institutions
        had been atrophied, cultural and religious transformations were important developments that contradicted the
        notion of a general decline. Partially, this can be applied to the economic side of Late Antiquity, that the
        period of Late Antiquity saw states grow on their own economic networks, while others saw decline.
      </p>
      <p> This of course will depend on the perspective of each country. For instance, the barbarians
        that resided near the empire typically saw greater economic development than barbarians that
        were farther from the borders of Rome. Roughly, this is due to the many trading initiatives between 
        Roman forts and barbarian encampments that were by the border. Archaeological data show that not only
        were the tools better, but invariably the agricultural practices also must have been better. It was typical
        for barbarian agriculture to be mobile: rarely was the soil turned upon itself to feedback nutrients into the environment,
        causing land to go sterile after a few harvests.
      </p>
      <p> For Rome, the economy is a different story. It is true that the era after Diocletian's reforms saw economic growth
        in some years, but overall, we see the decline of Roman cities. It becomes even more apparent once we see the 
        state of the Roman army in the late Roman Empire. Simply put, the late Roman Empire suffered from significant
        manpower shortages. Hence, the army would have to be supplemented with barbarian manpower on the occasion.
        Additionally, the current era called for different strategies than past systems. Rather than the aggressive conquering
        legion of Trajan in the principate, the Late Roman Empire was designed for security, meaning the organization of armies
        was designed to protect Roman borders. It becomes evident that when the economic decline of the late Roman Empire 
        was in full swing, the resources used to defend the empire also declined. This does not suggest that barbarians 
        outside the empire always took advantage of Rome when given the chance. Still, there are significant and powerful groups
        that put pressure on the empire's borders that make it difficult for Rome to protect all of its possessions. Additionally, 
        the late Roman Empire also saw the rise of the Sasanid Empire, which was a significantly more formidable opponent than the
        previous Partian Empire. As such, many instances of Roman garrisons were reassigned to the east, again allowing the plundering
        of the Roman heartland for opportunist groups. Compounded with the rise of the Huns meant that the Romans would face 
        meaningful threats to its economic dominance.
      </p>
      <p>That being said, life after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in former provinces would not have likely been too different
        than previous living. The states that succeeded the Roman Empire often maintained the institutions and bureaucracy to a similar
        degree to the Roman Empire, meaning that these states were centralized and effective in exercising state power. For example, King
        Odoacer, the man responsible for ending the Western Roman Empire politically, was credited as a competent ruler, with many construction
        projects that attribute to a centralized state. Thus, contrary to misconceptions about the Fall of Rome, Feudalism was not an
        economic system that was prevalent for many centuries after 476. In fact, the Eastern Roman Empire would continue on operating on
        a system that never truly resembled Feudalism even throughout the Medieval Age.

      <p>What we can see in this graph is the location of coin mints throughout the empire throughout the late Roman period.
        What is notable is that a lot of this wealth occurs in the Eastern half of the empire. In general, historians
        have noted that the Eastern half of the empire tended to have richer provinces, especially with the wealthy and 
        more fertile soils of the Middle East. This image puts into perspective the economic shortcomings
        of the Western Roman Empire. While there were of course mines that the empire could mint from, wealth
        generation would continue to be pushed further East.
