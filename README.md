# Full Stack Late Antiquity Website
NOTE: I run this website on my local machine by running a live server; the URL for this website does not exist.

This project combines my passion for history with skills from Computer Science to offer a summary assessment of the Late Antiquity era for novice learners. 
Additionally, I wanted this project to be full stack so that I could learn as much as possible, so I used a coinbase from FLAME's dataset of coin locations
to aid my argument for understanding Late Antiquity. I hope to educate people on what Late Antiquity meant, generated roughly from the book 'Empires and Barbarians'
by Peter Heather, and supplement the learning using Computer Science Techniques.

Because this is my first Full Stack project, I used fastAPI for the backend to demonstrate a proof of concept of this website. In the future, I hope to use
more common frameworks like MongoDB and Django. The backend was also done in Python since  that is the language I feel most comfortable with.
