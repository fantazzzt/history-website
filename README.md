# Full Stack History Website
This project combines my passion for history with skills from Computer Science to offer a summary assessment of the Late Antiquity era for novice learners. 
Additionally, I wanted this project to be full stack so that I could learn as much as possible, so I used a coinbase from FLAME's dataset of coin locations
to aid my argument for understanding Late Antiquity. I hope to educate people on what Late Antiquity meant, generated roughly from the book 'Empires and Barbarians'
by Peter Heather, and supplement the learning using Computer Science Techniques.
