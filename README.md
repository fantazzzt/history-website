# history-website
This project is combines my passion for history with skills from Computer Science to offer a summary assessment of the Late Antiquity era for novice learners. 
Additionally, I wanted this project to be fullstack so that I could learn as much as possible, so I used a coinbase from FLAME's dataset of coin locations
to aid my argument towards understanding Late Antiquity.
